# 🔍 Search Engine – A Google API-Powered CLI Query Tool

This project is a minimalist, fully functional command-line search engine built using Python and [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/), a real-time Google Search API. It takes user input in natural language and returns clean, structured search results including titles, links, and content snippets.

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

- Simulates the **backend logic of real-world search engines**
- Reinforces **HTTP requests, JSON parsing, and CLI input/output**
- Shows early initiative in **API integration** and **information retrieval**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **Requests** library
- **SerpAPI** (Google Search API)
- CLI (Command-Line Interface)

## 📦 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/search-engine.git
   cd search-engine
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install requests
Run the program:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 search.py
Enter your SerpAPI key and begin searching.

🧠 Potential Improvements
GUI version using Tkinter or Flask

Add query filters (e.g., time range, site)

Support for other search engines (Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc.)
